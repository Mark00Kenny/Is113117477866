                        </hgroup>
                        <p> I developed a keen interest in music from a young
                        age. All of my brothers and sisters were musicians, and
                        it was only natural that I found a love for listening to 
                        and playing music from being around them. At the age of
                        4 I began learning how to play the violin, under the tutelage of
                        Constantin Zanidachie and ever since then playing music has been a 
                        major part of my life ever since.

                        <h3> The Quartet</h3>
                        During my time as a musician, I was extremely lucky to be the 
                        violist in the 'Accelerando String Quartet.' Playing together 
                        with my close friends , Kevin Jansson, Seamus Hickey and Zara Finn was
                        immense fun and along the way we managed to play at many different venues
                        competitions, and courses.
                        Past performances included various corporate and charity events including the annual Simon Ball 
                        and events for the chartered accountants of Ireland, 
                        aswell as concerts in the National Concert hall and Castalia Hall.
                        In our 5 year stint we were tutored by Adrian Petcu and we
                        received masterclasses from members of the ICO, Vanbrugh Quartet, Danel Quartet and the Chiral Quartet. 
                        <br><br>
                        In my free time away from music 
                        and education I had a passion for writing. In the 
                        past year I decided to combine my two hobbies together and start writing 
                        songs as a means of expression. So far I've written four complete songs,
                        three of which are on Youtube.

                            <h3> James Blunt</h3>
                            <h3> My favourite musician </h3>
                            
                        </hgroup>
                        <p> James Blunt has always been my favourite singer/songwriter.
                        Whenever I listen to his music I always find that I can
                        relate to the lyrics and the sombre melodies always play upon
                        my mood. Without a doubt 1973 would be my favourite song of his as 
                        I have many memories associated with that song and James Blunt's work
                        also greatly inspired me to write my own music.
